# Project Template

A small repository that will get you set up an organized project and get data off the NEFSC oracle servers.  This repository contains:

1. A folder structure and some utilities that will (hopefully) help you keep things organized
1. Sample code for extracting data from oracle using stata.
1. Sample code for extracting data from oracle using R.
1. Sample code for using R to call stata.
1. Little bits of code from my ACE price project, in case it's useful.

# Prelude
Look on my code, ye Mighty, and despair!

## Cloning from Github and other setup
Min-Yang is using Rstudio to write .Rmd or .md documentation. He is also using Rstudio's git version control to commit/push/pull from github. It works reasonably well.  You will also need to install git.

The easist thing to do is to clone this repository to a place on your computer. [Here's a starting guide](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/).  Don't put spaces in the name.  Cloning the repository will set up many, but not all of the folders.

Min-Yang put the project into:
```
C:/Users/Min-Yang.Lee/Documents/project_templates
```
Pay attention to where you put this, you will need it later.

# Overview and Folder structure

This is mostly borrowed from the world bank's EDB. https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices
Please use forward slashes (that is C:/path/to/your/folder) instead of backslashes for unix/mac compatability. I'm forgetful about this. 

I keep each project in a separate folder.  The folder names get stored as a macro in stata's startup profile.do.  This lets me start working on any of my projects by opening stata and typing: 
```
do $my_project_name
```
Rstudio users using projects don't have to do anything for paths.

## Set up Oracle and ODBC
1.  Open up /stata_code/sample/odbc_connection_macro_sample.do. 
1.  Delete or Comment out the Operating system section that is irrelevant to you.  Enter your own information (oracle username and password).  
1.  Rename and save it in a place you can find that is NOT in this repository. Min-Yang put it into 
```
C:/Users/Min-Yang.Lee/Documents/common/odbc_setup_macros.do
```

Pay attention to where you put this, you will need it later.

### ODBC Setup
You'll have to get someone from ITD to setup your ODBC connections. It should looks something like this.

## Set up your profile.do

1. Open up /stata_code/sample/sample_profile.do.
1. Enter and modify with your own information (username,directories).  You will want the project_template global macro to point to the "project_logistics/folder_setup_globals.do" that is in your project directory (for me this is C:/Users/Min-Yang.Lee/Documents/project_templates\stata_code/project_logistics/folder_setup_globals.do
1. Save it as "C:\ado\profile.do".  [Here is the stata manual](https://www.stata.com/manuals15/gsub.pdf) about this.


## Set up the rest of the project. 
1. Open up "project_logistics/run_this_once-folder_setup.do"
1.  Add an "if" statement analogous to lines 15-18.  Put this below minyang's if statement.  Change the directory to match the one you used when you initially cloned this repository.
1. Open up "project_logistics/folder_setup_globals.do"
1.  Add an "if" statement analogous to lines 14-18. Put this below minyang's if statement.  Change the directory to match the one you used when you initially cloned this repository.  Change the quietly do line to run the bit of code that sets up your odbc connections.
1. start stata. Type
```
do $project_template 
do "/${my_codedir}/project_logistics/run_this_once_folder_setup.do" /*this line only needs to be run once*/
```


You can also set up folders in R by using the file 

"R_code/project_logistics/R_paths_libraries_setup.R"



# Sample code for extracting data from oracle using stata

do "/${extraction_code}/extract_from_sole.do"

should extract a table from sole. 


# Other Sample code for  stata
I've included some other code to get data into stata, including getting data from St. Louis Federal Reserve.  I've also left some bits of code that assemble and process data.

Also, take a look here: https://github.com/cameronspeir/NOAA-Foreign-Fishery-Trade-Data-API to get data from the NOAA Foreign fishery trade .


# Sample code for extracting data from oracle using R.
Code to extract data from oracle using R is here:

```
/R_code/data_extraction_processing/extraction/r_oracle_connection.R
```
Before using it, you should

1. Rename /R_code/project_logistics/R_code/R_credentials_sample.R to R_credentials.R.
1. Fill in your id, password, server names, hosts, and ports
1. Change the first line of  /R_code/project_logistics/R_code/R_paths_libraries_setup.R to point to your project directory. Source .
1. Make the same change to /R_code/data_extraction_processing/extraction/r_oracle_connection.R. Source.



# Sample code for using R to call stata.

This is in Rmd_stata_integration.Rmd. You should need to change only two lines of code:

1.  Line 12 of the Rmd_stata_integration.Rmd should be changed to the directory where you cloned this repository locally.
1.  Line 14 of stata_code/analysis/test1.do should also be changed to the same directory.
1.  Line 14 of stata_code/analysis/wrapper32.do should be changed to the same directory.

Sorry, I'm not slick enough to pass a little arguement through to a stata do file.


# Problems  

1. A little janky on setting up directories, that's life.
